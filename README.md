This repo serves as a "diary" kind of thing to track what I have done during the army.

Whatever I committed to this repo before January 9th 2025 is all written using vim on termius (IOS). For those curious about how I managed to code in the army, I opened a DigitalOcean droplet and ssh-ed into it using Termius (both available on IOS & Android) due to the lack of access to computer during my military service in Korea. Hence, whatever I added to this repo may not be in the state...
