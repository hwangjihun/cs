This repo serves as a "diary" kind of thing to track what I have done during the army.

Whatever I committed to this repo before January 9th 2025 (my ETS date) is all written using vim on termius (IOS). For those curious about how I managed to code without access to computers during my military service in Korea, I opened a DigitalOcean droplet and ssh-ed into it using Termius (both available on IOS & Android). Hence, whatever I added to this repo may not be in the best state...
